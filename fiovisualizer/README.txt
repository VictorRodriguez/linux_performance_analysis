 FIO visualizer 1.0 31 Dec 2014

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
 This tool is a data visualisation tool for FIO (http://freecode.com/projects/fio) written on PyQtGraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org).

 OVERVIEW
 --------
 PyQtGraph based visualizer for FIO. Requires to run on behalf of root user as requires access to block devices.

 PACKAGE CONTENT

 fio_visualizer.py
    application script.
 mainwindow.ui 
    GUI definition part of the script
 Workloads:
  - Device
     Block device workloads covering typical specifications, separated in SATA and NVMe sections
  - Precondition
     instruction and script files to prepare SSD for the testing.
  - Simulation
     Workloads to simulate real applications.
  - MultiDevice
     Workloads to test two or more drives at a time. Currently has limitted support due to improper handling of total performance in the script. 

 INSTALLATION
 ------------
 Requires:

  FIO (http://freecode.com/projects/fio)
  PyQtGraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
  Python 2.7 and 3+
  PyQt 4.8+ or PySide
  numpy
  scipy

 CentOS 7 steps:
 ---------------

  0. You should have python and PyQt installed with the OS

  1. Install pyqtgraph-develop (0.9.9 required) form http://www.pyqtgraph.org
	 $ python setup.py install

  2. Install Cyphon from http://cython.org Version 0.21 or higher is required.
	 $ python setup.py install

  3. Install Numpy from http://numpy.org 
	 $ python setup.py build
	 $ python setup.py install

  4. Install FIO from http://freecode.com/projects/fio
	 # ./configure
	 # make
	 # make install

  5. Run Visualizer under root.
         # ./fio-visualizer.py


 Ubuntu steps:
 -------------
  1. Add repository "deb http://luke.campagnola.me/debian dev/" into your /etc/apt/sources.list
    	sudo apt-get install fio python-pyqtgraph

  2. Install FIO from http://freecode.com/projects/fio
	 # ./configure
	 # make
	 # make install

  3. Run Visualizer under root.
         # ./fio-visualizer.py


 LIMITATIONS
 -----------
  1. Increased CPU load with numjobs > 4 and all threads plotting. Avoid plotting all threads 
     with numjobs > 4 or disable unneccessary ones to save CPU time.
  2. Multi-jobs configurations files (i.e. [job1]... [job2]) are not supported at the moment.
     The total amount of jobs if every workload has "numjobs" specified too are not correctly parsed.

 TODO
 ----
  1. Continue working on Simulation workloads. It's plimitted at the moment.
