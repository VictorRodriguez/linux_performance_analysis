There are multiple ways how you can prepare the drive for the benchmarking. 
Here are basic steps to follow to get reliable data at the end:
1. Secure Erase SSD

2. Fill SSD with sequential data twice of it's capacity. This will gurantee all available 
   memory is filled with a data including factory provisioned area. DD is the easiest way for this:
   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=/dev/"devicename"

3. If you're running sequential workload to estimate the read or write throughput then skip the next step.

4. Fill the drive with 4k random data. The same rule, total amount of data is twice drive's capacity.
   Use FIO for this purpose. Here is an example script for NVMe SSD:
	[global]
	name=4k random write 4 ios in the queue in 32 queues
	filename=/dev/nvme0n1
	ioengine=libaio
	direct=1
	bs=4k
	rw=randwrite
	iodepth=4
	numjobs=32
	buffered=0
	size=100%
	loops=2	
	[job1]
 
5. Run your workload. Usually meassurements starts after 5 minutes of runtime in order to let the SSD FW 
   adopting to the workload. It's called sustained performance state. This time depends on the SSD 
   Vendor/SKU/capacity.
